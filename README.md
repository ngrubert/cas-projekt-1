1. Introduction

===========================================================

This is my first Javascript application. I created it as a project work for the
"CAS Front End Engineering" at Hochschule Rapperswil (http://www.hsr.ch).

I have a background in Python based Web-Frameworks so creating a
Javascript based web application was a complete new way of programming. Some Javascript typical behaviour made
me crazy in the beginning. If you come from the Python world, some things are really strange in Javascript so
I had to re-read the Javascript pitfalls and search for explainations quite often.
However, I am happy to have my first Javascript app running.

2. Installation

===========================================================

  - Make sure you have Node.js and the node package manager "npm" installed on your machine

  - Git clone this repository

  - Change to your cloned directory and run:

        npm install

  - This installs all the required modules

  - Run the app.js either with Node.js on the the command line or within Webstorm

  - Open the app in your browser with this URL:

        http://127.0.0.1:3001

As this was my first Javascript application I guess there are many things which can be improved.
I have some more features to be implemented on my list - e.g. polling with sockets.
Do not hesitate to send your comments as I like to learn new things and want to become more
familiar with Javascript very soon.
